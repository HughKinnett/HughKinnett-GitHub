        <h1>About Me!</h1>
        <p>I currently reside in my hometown of Fitzgerald, Georgia.I'm a dad to a five-year-old princess. After not graduating high school, I decided to continue my education. I obtained my GED when I was twenty-three years old. I continued working in manufacturing after obtaining my GED. At the age of twenty-seven, I decide to attend college. I decided to attend Ashford University. I graduate with my Bachelor of Arts in Journalisma and Mass Communication in 2020. After graduating from college, I couldn't find work locally in journalism. I continued working in manufacturing after obtaining my college degree. I decided to learn to code in 2020. Even though I worked, 60+ hours a week, I stayed committed to learning to code. I now work over sixty hours a week in manufacturing while I code in my freetime.</p>
