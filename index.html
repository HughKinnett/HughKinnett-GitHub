    <h1>The Importance of GitHub for Modern Developers</h1>
    <p>You may have scrolled through the internet, an article on the web, or a social media feed and seen where a developer was talking about using GitHub, but you don't know how to use GitHub. Or you may feel that using GitHub isn't important because you have been developing alone. </p>
    <p>However, you have recently met come developers that have code on GitHub you want to look at. Or you may have some code you want someone else to take a look at, but you don't have the code on GitHub, the code files are only on your computer.</p>
    <h1>What is GitHub</h1>
    <p>GitHub is a platform to not only store and develop software, it is also a place for numerous developers to work on the same project without being in the same location. GitHub allows for developers around the world to work on the same project. <a href="https://github.blog/2023-01-25-100-million-developers-and-counting/">Thomas Dohmke</a> in a 2023 article stated, "Today, Iâ€™m excited to share that there are now officially more than 100 million developers using GitHub to build, maintain, and contribute to software projects." Therefore, if you come across a developer, they more than likely use GitHub. Also, all of the websites and apps you use are more than likely on GitHub.</p>
    <h1>GitHub is Great for Practice</h1>
    <p>If you are reading this, you are either a coder or you have been thinking about getting into code. You may also be thinking about using or have used GitHub. However, you may not know where to start. I didn't know where to start when I began learning GitHub either.</p>
