    <h1>The Importance of GitHub for Modern Developers</h1>
    <p>You may have scrolled through the internet, an article on the web, or a social media feed and seen where a developer was talking about using GitHub, but you don't know how to use GitHub. Or you may feel that using GitHub isn't important because you have been developing alone. </p>
    <p>However, you have recently met come developers that have code on GitHub you want to look at. Or you may have some code you want someone else to take a look at, but you don't have the code on GitHub, the code files are only on your computer.</p>
    <h1>What is GitHub</h1>
    <p>GitHub is a platform to not only store and develop software, it is also a place for numerous developers to work on the same project without being in the same location. GitHub allows for developers around the world to work on the same project. </p>
