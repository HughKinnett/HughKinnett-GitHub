    <h1>The Importance of GitHub for Modern Developers</h1>
    <p>You may have scrolled through the internet, an article on the web, or a social media feed and seen where a developer was talking about using GitHub, but you don't know how to use GitHub. Or you may feel that using GitHub isn't important because you have been developing alone. </p>
    <p>However, you have recently met come developers that have code on GitHub you want to look at. Or you may have some code you want someone else to take a look at, but you don't have the code on GitHub, the code files are only on your computer.</p>
    <h1>What is GitHub</h1>
    <p>GitHub is a platform to not only store and develop software, it is also a place for numerous developers to work on the same project without being in the same location. GitHub allows for developers around the world to work on the same project. <a class="link" href="https://github.blog/2023-01-25-100-million-developers-and-counting/">Thomas Dohmke</a> in a 2023 article stated, "Today, Iâ€™m excited to share that there are now officially more than 100 million developers using GitHub to build, maintain, and contribute to software projects." Therefore, if you come across a developer, they more than likely use GitHub. Also, all of the websites and apps you use are more than likely on GitHub.</p>
    <h1>GitHub is Great for Practice</h1>
    <p>If you are reading this, you are either a coder or you have been thinking about getting into code. You may also be thinking about using or have used GitHub. However, you may not know where to start. I didn't know where to start when I began learning GitHub either.</p>
    <p>First of all, I decided to write articles. However, I do have a journalism degree that I have never used, right? While you may not know how to write well or you don't know what to write, browse the web and find something that you are interested in and give your take on it. So many articles are written that they are all aligned in one way, some are the same information just written differently.</p>
    <h1>Working on Open Source Software on GitHub</h1>
    <p>Once you learn to use GitHub, you can always find open source software on GitHub to contribute to. In a December 2023 article <a class="link" href="https://gitnux.org/open-source-software-statistics/#:~:text=There%20are%20more%20than%2030%20million,open-source%20projects%20hosted%20on%20the%20GitHub%20platform.">Jannik Lindner</a> stated,"There are more than 30 million open-source projects hosted on the GitHub platform." Open source software is a great way to practice your craft as well as get known in the development community. Many people choose to not take part in open source software because the contributors do not get paid. However, the participation in open source software can lead you to better paying opportunities further down the road in your development journey.</p>
    <h1>What Made Me Learn GitHub</h1>
    <p>I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I saved my code on my computer. Saving my code locally left me with a fear that my code would somehow be deleted and all the work I put into the code would be gone. I started reading articles about where people stored their code. I learned that majority of the developers saved their code on GitHub, the ones that didn't were normally developers that were just learning to code. When I decided to learn GitHub, I thought it would be simple. It was, but I had to take a little time reading articles and watching videos. I found <a class="YouTube-link" href="https://youtu.be/3RjQznt-8kE?si=m2kxOAH-T05VbwnG">Net Ninja</a> on YouTube very helpful, I followed along and could use GitHub as a beginner after watching his playlist.</p>
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>Day after day we scroll through the news and see tech companies laying off people. While I feel that AI will not take over web developing jobs completely this soon, I feel that people that are getting laid off at the large companies will not want to go back to development jobs that pay them very little money. Therefore, web development jobs are a great entry place in the tech community. While GitHub isn't needed to learn to code, it is needed if you want to feel that your code is safe and won't be deleted if something happens to your local files. Also, you can take part in open source projects and allow other developers to take part in your projects if you choose to go that route. While you are learning GitHub, you can choose to make your repository private so only you can see the code.</p>
